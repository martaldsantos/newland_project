# newland_project

Newland’s goal to find the optimal taxation structure depends on the discernment taken on the
salaries’ of the citizens, labelling its citizens (1 - salary above average and 0 otherwise). Therefore, this study
aimed at the training of a model to predict the desired categories. 

Through the usage of several data cleaning and transformation procedures and heterogeneous Machine Learning algorithms, it was possible to train such models, estimate and calibrate their hyperparameters, compare them and see which one provided the best outcome. With the results, a correct and easy-to-implement estimation of the requirements for the tributation system into the new planet becomes now possible.
